How A Spud Got Away! 

Overview
This project is a Python application designed to showcase the skills and topics learned in phase 3 of the Flatiron School. It includes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for database management and a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction. The application allows users to play a game in the terminal of their computers to accuse and find the killer in efforts of winning.

ORM Requirements
The application utilizes Python ORM methods for database creation and modification.
Data model includes at least 2 model classes.
Data model includes at least 1 one-to-many relationship.
Property methods are defined to add appropriate constraints to each model class.
Each model class includes ORM methods for create, delete, get all, and find by id operations.
CLI Requirements
The CLI displays menus for user interaction.
Loops are used to keep the user in the application until they choose to exit.
For each class in the data model, the CLI includes options to create an object, delete an object, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute.
The CLI validates user input and object creations/deletions, providing informative errors to the user.
OOP Best Practices
Project code follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) best practices.
Dependencies
The Pipfile contains all needed dependencies and no unneeded dependencies.
Imports are used in files only where necessary.
Project Organization
Project folders, files, and modules are organized and follow appropriate naming conventions.

Usage
Playing a Python game in the terminal typically involves running a Python script that contains the game logic. Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to play a Python game in the terminal:
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org if you haven't already.
Instructions:

        Download the Game Script:
    
Download the Python script for the game you want to play. It could be a file with a .py extension.

    
Open Terminal or Command Prompt:
Open your terminal or command prompt application. This could be Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows.

    
Navigate to the Directory:
once you have python downloaded to your machine then â€”> 
    
Use the cd command to navigate to the terminal or command line directory where the game script is located.
pipenv install
pipenv shell 
cd hkk-p3-project         Copy code4. cd lib/ python detective-game.py
Follow On-Screen Instructions:
Once you run the script, the game should start in the terminal. Follow any on-screen instructions or prompts provided by the game.
Play the Game:
Use the keyboard to interact with the game. Depending on the game, you might need to use the numbers provided on screento navigate menus, make selections, and play the game itself.
Quit the Game:
To quit the game, follow any in-game instructions for exiting or simply close the terminal or command prompt window.

That's it! You should now be able to play the Python game in the terminal. Enjoy!
